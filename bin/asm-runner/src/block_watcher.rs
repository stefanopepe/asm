//! Minimal Bitcoin block watcher for the ASM runner.
//!
//! Subscribes to a bitcoind `rawblock` ZMQ topic and feeds new blocks to the
//! ASM worker. If the ZMQ stream skips heights (bitcoind catch-up, missed
//! messages, restart), the gap is backfilled.
//!
//! This is a glue-like replacement for the `btc-tracker` that asm-runner needs:
//! real-time block notification with `bury_depth=0` (no reorg tracking, no
//! tx monitoring). Written to avoid a painful dependency on `strata-bridge`.
